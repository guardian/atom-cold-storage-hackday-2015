Content Atom - Cold Storage
===========================

This is the place where Atoms, once published, will be available for all time
(until they are deleted anyway).

It will provide a REST API for accessing atoms, and thier lifecycle events.

It will look something like this:

+ `GET /atoms`: get all atoms in a paginated list

+ `GET /atom/:id`: get full details of a specific atom
